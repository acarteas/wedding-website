                        It all started with a turtle. Adam was browsing the dating site Ok Cupid and came across Chia’s
                        profile. Thinking she was cute, Adam realized that she probably got quite a few messages from
                        other
                        men. He knew that he had to be clever and concise. Adam knew he had an “in” when he came across
                        a
                        photo of Chia swimming with a turtle. So, he typed up something clever and clicked send. At the
                        time, Adam didn’t realize that Chia has a special connection to turtles. His message cut through
                        the
                        noise and he got his date.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us">
                        They hit it off right away and after their first date at Phikun's Thai restaurant. Early on,
                        Chia
                        remembers quite fondly that as they lay in the wheatfields outside of her house and gaze up into
                        the
                        stars, Adam states “If nights were just like these forever, I would propose to you right now.”
                        Well
                        as any of you know, love is complicated and there are the good times and the hard times. Adam
                        and
                        Chia have had both. But love is in part a choice. We choose to love and we choose to commit to
                        the
                        ones we love.

                    <p class="about-us">
                        After dating for about fifteen months, and living with each other for about nine months, Adam
                        and
                        Chia parted ways. Adam had just graduated Washington State University and he was offered a
                        full-time
                        teaching position at Humboldt State University. Prior to applying to HSU, Chia insisted that
                        Adam
                        apply to one school in CA because Chia wanted to move back to her home state. Low and behold,
                        after
                        applying to a handful of schools, Adam was offered a job in California.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us">
                        Their relationship became rocky during the time surrounding his graduation in May of 2016 and
                        Adam
                        moved down to Eureka, CA without his Califonian sweetheart. Chia stayed in Pullman, WA, and
                        completed her M.A. degree in Anthropology.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us">
                        After about a year and a half apart, Chia and Adam started talking again. After a few months of
                        talking to Adam on the phone
                        and
                        skyping, Chia took a leap of faith and moved to Eureka to be with Adam.
                    </p>
                    <p class="about-us">
                        On 2’s 2/22/22, Adam and Chia will have known each other for seven years. They will have dated
                        for 5
                        and a ½ years and they look forward to spending the next seventy years with each other.

                                    when booking your stay. Note that it looks like the hotel code is more expensive but
                                    that is because the code includes the typical $40/night resort fee. </p>
